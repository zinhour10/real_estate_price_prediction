It is located on the third floor of a twin villa and is now offered for sale at a negotiable price. Upon entering, you will find a more-or-less plain interior livened up by splashes of aquamarine, mostly in the staircase (which doubles as a shelf and television stand) and kitchen counter. The blue sofa set and TV are included in the sale, so the buyer will definitely enjoy the same aesthetics. Meanwhile, the kitchen has contrasting accents of black on the countertop and bench cushions. It is likewise fully equipped with a refrigerator, sink, microwave oven, and cooker with exhaust. Beyond, you will find the first bedroom which has a wide window for lots of sunlight and good ventilation. The second bedroom is located on the loft. It is more spacious than the first and features a uniquely designed attached bathroom that maximizes space and efficiency. It is also from the loft area that one can access the hind balcony: a quaint lounge or mini tea area where you can also tend a simple garden. As it is accessible from an external, third-floor entrance, you will also have a front view of the surrounding street/neighborhood. This property is a mere five (5) minutes from ABA Bank, Lucky Supermarket, Pet Chen Pharmacy, and Central Hospital, and eight (8) minutes from Wat Phnom, the National University of Management, the Phnom Penh Night Market, the National Library, and Vattanac Capital.\n",

The uniqueness of its interior design is the key to induce an utmost pleasure of a stay.

To define each room, wood, marble and rough linen are the perfect options for here that  showcases the grace and profound natural gifts, like daylight, airspace and panoramic view. Adopting genuine, more solid and more eco-friendly materials so as to abandon flimsy and disposable consumption habits, it was how the founders intended to greatly impress their visitors once they step out of the elevator.

The hotel is situated on such a vantage point that a first time guest often finds it breathtaking while standing by the modern glass wall.
