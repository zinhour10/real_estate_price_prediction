The Snowbell Hotel@The Bridge SOHO hosts 75 rooms/suites with thrilling views, which completely occupy two floors, namely the 28th & 29th, in one of the city landmark - Bridge SOHO Tower. It marks as one of the few high-rise hotels in the Kingdom. And there are two swimming pools on the rooftop, one outdoor and another indoor, where SnowbellÂs guests can enjoy a dip or do some laps and can possess a feel like sky floating at about 180 metres above the ground. The uniqueness of its interior design is the key to induce an utmost pleasure of a stay. Since its initial  hand-sketch began, the design has been all about a minimalist concept molded in built-to-last materials. To define each room, wood, marble and rough linen are the perfect options for here that  showcases the grace and profound natural gifts, like daylight, airspace and panoramic view. Adopting genuine, more solid and more eco-friendly materials so as to abandon flimsy and disposable consumption habits, it was how the founders intended to greatly impress their visitors once they step out of the elevator. So to believe that high-rise hotels can be very sophisticated and very much tranquil. The concept was already proven attractive before the hotelÂs completion as it had been copied and counterfeited elsewhere while still in its half-way building. All 75 but one of the rooms are granted with unrivalled panorama of the heart of Phnom Penh dotted with landmarks and rivers. The hotel is situated on such a vantage point that a first time guest often finds it breathtaking while standing by the modern glass wall. Apart from the sky gym, sauna and pool, there is an award-winning restaurant and sky garden where you can sit down for fine food and drinks, and overlook the skyline punctuated by embassies, the Assembly, the casino and many more without any obstacle.
