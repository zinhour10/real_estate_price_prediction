Borey NADI is a new luxury community development marrying luxury modern living with natural beauty set in the up-and-coming district of Chroy Changvar. This 34-hectare residential development features a wide range of premium homes built with a unique aesthetic set within a tranquil verdant landscape surrounded by the untouched greeneries and serve rivers that define Phnom Penhs geographic identity. Paying homage to the mighty waterways that flank Chroy Changvar, this new borey derives its name from the Sanskrit word NADI which means flowing lake or water. The word is similarly associated with strong expressions of love or desire - the prime reasons why NADI is where the home begins. Borey NADI is a large-scale development that captures the growing desire of Cambodians for a new-age home fit for a modernizing Cambodia. Its portfolio of homes is carefully crafted to be easy on the eyes yet striking in a way that leaves an impression, and even a vision of what the future of luxury borey living should be. The project will have over 1,000 residential units that will cover the ever-expanding preferences of the Cambodian home seeker. Each home is built with a grand design in mind, achieved through the use of rounded edges and curves that flow from one part of each home to another. This allows each home to be distinct and, at the same time, seamlessly fit into a neighborhood profile that defines each phase. The project has 3 total phases with each phase featuring a particular home type that highlights the desired lifestyle. Phase I will have Link Houses, Shop Houses, and Twin Villas, homes popular among landed property seekers looking to live abundantly within a tight-knit neighborhood. The projects Phase II & III will house exclusive King and Queen villas made for families looking for space where they can have a lifestyle that allows them to play, grow, and explore without being too far away from the rest of the community. After all, the great things in life are best enjoyed with family and friends. Complementing these luxury homes are an equally premium set of amenities and facilities that presents Borey NADI homeowners with more choices to rest, relax, and have fun. The project will have a Private Club House that will include a swimming pool, coffee shop, gym, entertainment room, and childrens playroom - an ideal place where interests create memorable shared experiences. Beyond the Private Club House, residents can treat themselves to their very own Cherry Blossom park, a.k.a. The Cambodia Sakura Park and Crystal Hall. An Elephant Path and a large Kids Playground will also be on the grounds, perfect for residents looking for outdoor activities without having to leave the comfort and security of Borey NADI. In Phnom Penhs flurry of residential developments, Borey NADI still stands out with its unique take on a new way to think about gated communities in Cambodia. And being situated in the hot property area of Chroy Changvar, Borey NADI presents prospecting homebuyers a chance to ride the wave of what could well be the future of luxury boreys.

Superb Scenic Riverside Land for Sale in Srea Ambel, Koh Kong. Koh Kong is going to be the success story of Cambodia in this decade. One of the most stunning provinces in Cambodia is about to become the capital of eco-tourism in the coming years. As we have seen over the last two decades, Cambodia is on the move. A country that saw over a decade of economic growth higher than China on occasion during this time has also seen its land prices rise steadily. A plethora of infrastructure projects around the country has resulted in Cambodia being firmly placed on the map as a tourist destination. No longer a haven just for backpackers, the country is now well-equipped to handle every kind of tourist from budget to 5-star visitors. Why Srea Ambel? Located in Koh Kong, the area in question is already moving forward at an incredible pace. New roads are being developed on this land and around the area as the local government attracts resorts and eco-tourism. This area of Srea Ambel has already set itself up for eco-tourism with the Kirirom III Hydroelectric Dam that has become a tourist attraction with a picturesque and photogenic trail. The trail provides some of the countries most stunning views, including Viewpoint, where the 360-degree view is nothing but breathtaking. As you will see from the images, a new access road is being built for the land, and there are plans for more in the area. The local government feel strongly about the benefits of eco-tourism in this part of Koh Kong. The Koh Kong Provincial Administration, over the past two years, have structured administrative proposals to develop eco-tourism throughout communities. Setting up community shelters aims to protect sites and areas, such as Trapeang Pris natural fish sanctuary in Chroy Svay commune, Sre Ambel district. In November 2020, Sok Sothy, the Deputy Governor of the Province of Koh Kong, touched on the establishment of eco-tourism development in the area. Together with the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, a new action plan on project locations, project action plan and project budget are underway for the province. Srea Ambel will undergo a significant transformation this decade, and we will see the government promote and support eco-tourism and the area with infrastructure projects and plenty of marketing. Land prices start at $13.50 p/m2. Given the governments incentives and planned infrastructure, this will yet again be a success story for our clientele.

Century Plaza is a new commercial shopping area rising in Por Senchey right along the Russian Boulevard. It is developed by JLECC, an established property developer with multiple international certifications working with the Cambodian government in developing Por Senchey into a modern residential and commercial hub in Phnom Penh. 1. Gateway to Cambodia Century Plaza is only 2 mins away from the Phnom Penh International Airport, making it one of the first structures visitors will see when they enter Phnom Penh. The project is designed to showcase the strides Phnom Penhs property sector has made through use of open spaces, natural lighting, and its unique triangular design that takes advantage of its 3-corner property location. 2. A modern business and shopping centre Century Plaza is a commercial complex integrating shopping, entertainment, office, and hotel functions in Phnom Penhs busiest urban area. It stands in place of the much-visited old market, taking all that has made it immediately popular to the people of Por Senchey, and giving it a fresh and modern look befitting Phnom Penhs continuing development. The project has a total of 6 floors and 2 basement floors. Each floor will host a wide range of stores where its 670 (and growing) store owners are already getting ready to sell various goods in the Century Plaza once it opens towards the end of 2021. After its completion, Century Plaza is expected to be the commercial landmark of Por Senchey and will likely be the immediate stop for international tourists and business travelers given its proximity to the airport. Most importantly, however, the projects popularity to many of Por Sencheys residents make it a convenient shopping destination for them. 3. Accessible to Por Sencheys huge population Por Senchey is one of the most populated districts in Phnom Penh with over 230,000 residents; over 10% of Phnom Penhs 2.1 million people. Workers living in Por Senchey often work in more central districts passing through the Russian Federation Boulevard - where the Century Plaza is immediately noticeable and easy to get to. In addition to being right along Russian Federation Boulevard, the Century Plaza is easy to get to for residents living some ways away from major roads. The project is directly accessible via road 2009 and 2005, allowing much more foot traffic within Por Sencheys denser population centres to get to the Century Plaza. The Century Plaza is located within the airport circle, its integration of shopping malls with hotels makes it an easy choice place for tourists and business travelers to visit, and also provides high-quality accommodation for the airport flight crew where they can enjoy shopping conveniences without being far away from the airport.

Profitable 2-Story, 4-Bedroom House for Sale  Only $49,980! Looking for a smart investment or a comfortable home in a prime location? This 2-story, 4-bedroom house is now available for sale at an unbeatable price of $49,980. Whether you are an investor or a homebuyer, this property offers high financial benefits, strong rental income, and great financing options. Key Benefits of Buying This House ? Steady Rental Income Currently rented for $200 per month, providing immediate passive income. The tenant has a one-year contract and earns a high income from their business. ? Prime Location with High Demand The house is positioned between two major streets, one connecting to a market in the east and another leading to a second market nearby. Strong rental demand due to its highly convenient location for businesses and residents. ? Easy Financing with High Loan Approval The house comes with a hard title, making it eligible for bank financing. A real estate professional has estimated its value at $70,000. Banks can provide up to 70% of the estimated value, meaning buyers can secure a loan of $49,000which fully covers the selling price. Some banks, such as Shinhan Bank and other local banks, offer low-interest rates, as low as 5.7% to 6% annually. ? Affordable Ownership with Rental Offsetting Loan Payments With a 70% bank loan ($49,000), buyers only need to cover minor additional costs. The rental income of $200/month can significantly reduce the financial burden of loan payments. Depending on the banks interest rate and loan terms, the buyer may only need to spend a little over $100 per month from their own funds while the rental income covers most of the loan repayment. In 6-7 years, the house will be fully paid off with minimal financial strain. Why Buy Now? Immediate rental income and a prime location ensure a great return on investment. Flexible bank financing allows buyers to acquire the house without requiring full upfront payment. Property value is increasing, making it a secure and profitable long-term investment. This is a rare opportunity to own a valuable property with low financial risk and high potential rewards. Act now before its gone!

What this property lacks in parking, it more than makes up for in style, comfort, and functionality. It is located on the third floor of a twin villa and is now offered for sale at a negotiable price. Upon entering, you will find a more-or-less plain interior livened up by splashes of aquamarine, mostly in the staircase (which doubles as a shelf and television stand) and kitchen counter. The blue sofa set and TV are included in the sale, so the buyer will definitely enjoy the same aesthetics. Meanwhile, the kitchen has contrasting accents of black on the countertop and bench cushions. It is likewise fully equipped with a refrigerator, sink, microwave oven, and cooker with exhaust. Beyond, you will find the first bedroom which has a wide window for lots of sunlight and good ventilation. The second bedroom is located on the loft. It is more spacious than the first and features a uniquely designed attached bathroom that maximizes space and efficiency. It is also from the loft area that one can access the hind balcony: a quaint lounge or mini tea area where you can also tend a simple garden. As it is accessible from an external, third-floor entrance, you will also have a front view of the surrounding street/neighborhood. This property is a mere five (5) minutes from ABA Bank, Lucky Supermarket, Pet Chen Pharmacy, and Central Hospital, and eight (8) minutes from Wat Phnom, the National University of Management, the Phnom Penh Night Market, the National Library, and Vattanac Capital.

With sturdy wooden flooring, modern lightweight furnishings, and a wide corner balcony, this single-room abode with a spacious dining/living hall and separate kitchen is a rare gem amid the bustling city center. It has a laidback style that offers solace in an otherwise busy area of the city, with more floor area than most one-bedroom units. The bedroom itself is a cozy retreat from the hustle and bustle of Phnom Penh, with a focal point being the built-in rattan dresser with multiple compartments at the bottom as well as overhead. A mounted television is included in this room, which overall gives a relaxing vibe with the simple wooden bedframe and floor pattern. This is complemented by the bathroom, which is a long hall with a double sink, two round mirrors, and separate, elevated section for the toilet and shower area. The separate kitchen is another distinguishing feature, minimizing any cramped feeling in the unit. Meanwhile, the balcony will give you a view overlooking the neighborhood, from the vintage twin villa style buildings to the skyscrapers in the horizon. It is located in Khan 7 Makara, Phnom Penh, three (3) minutes from Vattanac Capital, CamEd Business School, Preah Ang Duong Hospital, and Olympia City, and eight (8) minutes from the Old Stadium, Kamplerng Kouch Kanong Circle, Hun Sen Bun Rany Wat Phnom High School, and Tuol Sangke Market.

Yuetai Phnom Penh Harbour is strategically situated on a prime location in the capital, where it is set to become a one-of-a-kind and stunning riverfront landmark development along the Tonle Sap River, just one block away from the Royal Palace. Occupying approximately 1.2 million sqm, the project will become the most comprehensive commercial development with a construction area of 1.17 million sqm. Within this project, people will experience the impressive Khmer culture through contemporary history, arts, custom, and tourism. This mix-used construction is meant to be one of the most popular destinations for visitors to Phnom Penh, which is attracting people from all over the world. The project will be developed in four phases. The first phase of the project stretches between Chroy Changvar Bridge and Administration Building of Phnom Penh Autonomous Port. The second phase stretches between Administration Building of Phnom Penh Autonomous Port and the Ports southern wall. The third phase is between site of ship repair & maintenance and outside wall of Bassac Restaurant. Finally, the fourth phase is between Bassac Restaurant and Titanic Restaurant. The first phase of the development is a cultural tourism center, China-Cambodia Cultural Center. It comes with a leading Chinese hotel brand - White Swan Hotel, along with duty-free shops, Cambodian commercial streets, office buildings, SOHO, and huge underground spaces for the internal traffic to travel inside the underground, and for the external traffic to travel outside. The second phase, the CBD along the river in Phnom Penh, will consist of two high-rise twin office buildings, modern shopping malls, contemporary apartments, and a ferris wheel. The third and fourth phases will consist of four high-rise riverfront residential buildings that afford its occupants stunning views of the city. Shopping areas will be located on the ground floor of each building. The Art and Culture Exhibition Hall will rise in the fourth phase, where it will be built close to the Royal Palace. Yuetai Phnom Penh Harbour features several major facilities, including international shopping mall, riverside plaza, underground space for traveling in and outside of the city, culture and arts avenue, commercial street, fine arts hall, Angkor culture and arts exhibition hall, ferris wheel, culture and arts performance hall, cultural park, Phnom Penh tourist center, etc. One of the most creative ideas in Yuetai Phnom Penh Harbour is the integration of two different commercial models, a commercial avenue and a shopping center, into one project to produce double satisfaction to customers during their visit. The Yuetai Phnom Penh Harbours concept of commercial avenue is a combination of Cambodian and modern styles, with water as the central element. Each store will be created with a unique design concept. These features create a modern commercial street that is attractive to both local and international visitors. Another important feature/concept of the modern design is the large-scale shopping mall. Nine storeys high (including 2 storeys underground), it covers 120,000 sqm. It has 3,500 car parks and 2,000 motorcycle parking spaces, and features Khmer-style decorations. The mall will bring brand outlets, retail shops, boutique shops, department stores and a wide range of other businesses like a cinema with a 20-meter wide screen, KTV, game centers, childrens playground, beauty salon, large food court, and so on. These facilities and amenities are created to meet the demands for a grand urban lifestyle.
